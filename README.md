# AI Model for Reducing Elderly Loneliness

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system designed to help reduce the loneliness of elderly individuals. The system uses conversational AI and sentiment analysis to provide companionship and meaningful interactions.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notice**
- This repository is **not created for my real project** but as a **practice experiment** to fine-tune DeepSeek.
- The dataset used **is not suitable for my actual project**; instead, it was generated to **experiment with fine-tuning DeepSeek** and learn how to **prepare datasets for it**.

## Key Features
- **Conversational AI**: Simulates human-like conversations to engage users.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes emotions to tailor responses.
- **Optimized for Low-Bandwidth & Offline Inference**: Uses TensorFlow Lite (TF Lite) for efficient performance.

## Dataset Information
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notice**
- The dataset used in this project is **synthetically generated using ChatGPT** and is not based on real-world data.
- It is created solely for **experimental and research purposes**.

## Model & Approach
- Utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques.
- Processes user input through **text embeddings, sentiment analysis, and conversational AI algorithms**.
- Supports **offline inference via TensorFlow Lite (TF Lite)** for better accessibility.

## Purpose of This Repository
- **Experimental DeepSeek Fine-Tuning**: The main goal of this repository is to **test how to fine-tune DeepSeek** for conversational AI.
- **Dataset Preparation Practice**: Learning how to structure datasets properly for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).
- **Not a Final Project**: This is a **practice implementation** and does not reflect the final version of the project.
